# rust65

6502 emulator written to learn Rust with. Configured by default to emulate an expanded Apple I system.

Work in progress. Wozmon works perfectly, Integer BASIC runs well, however Applesoft Lite does not recognize commands. A preconfigured, downloadable build for Windows is available in the releases section, which includes the ROM found in the Replica 1 kit. Typing E000R and hitting enter will get you into Integer BASIC.
