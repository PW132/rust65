# rust65

6502 emulator written to learn Rust with. Configured by default to emulate an expanded Apple I system.

Work in progress. Wozmon works perfectly, Integer BASIC runs well, however Applesoft Lite does not recognize commands. Interrupts are not currently implemented. A complete, downloadable build will be released once interrupts and some quality-of-life features are implemented. In the meantime, feel free to browse my source code.
