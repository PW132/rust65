# rust65

6502 emulator written to learn Rust with. Configured by default to emulate an expanded Apple I system.

Work in progress, currently has all but 2 CPU opcodes implemented. Wozmon works perfectly, Integer BASIC runs but has problems with subtraction operations. Interrupts are not currently supported. A complete, downloadable build will be released once these issues are fixed. In the meantime, feel free to browse my source code.
